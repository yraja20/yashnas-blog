                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>I found some great examples of websites similar to my interactive narrative project, which is going to be a portfolio of my design work. The examples I found were of professional designers' portfolio websites. They have inspired me in terms of layout, fonts, color, and content, and will be helpful examples to refer to as I create my own portfolio website.</p>

                <h3>Simplicity</h3>
                    <p>Having looked at many portfolio site examples, I found that the simplicity of them really stood out to me. Most of them are very basic--they tend to involve a lot of negative space, basic grids, and straight lines.</p> 
                    <br>
                    <p>A great example of this grid design is from designer Chloe Meister's site, show below--she includes a hover interaction that allows you to read the title of the project "underneath" its cover photo. This both cleans up the site visually by eliminating the need for a title around the photo, and adds to a natural atmosphere by reacting to the user's movement.</p>

                    <figure class="post3fig"><img src="images/examplegrid.jpg" alt="portfolio website grid" width="500" height="268"></figure>
                        
                    <p>In many portfolio sites, the fonts are rather plain; decorative fonts are used sparingly for large display sections if anything. The language itself is also simple. The content is broken up a lot and often projects are described plainly--photos are used to do most of the talking.</p> 
                    <br>
                    <p>By keeping things relatively simple, the designers' projects are the main highlight, which speaks to the purpose of the website. This is something I would like to keep in mind with my own portfolio: simplicity lends itself to making my projects the focus of my site. </p>

                <h3>Color Palettes</h3>
                    <p>It is key to choose a good color palette for a website with many reasons, with legibility as the most important one. I noticed that many of these example sites had white or off-white backgrounds. This goes hand-in-hand with simplicity and is a surefire way to maintain legibility of many font colors.</p> 
                    <br>
                    <p>However, I find white to be a bit overused and will either choose an off-white or a very light pastel color, to maintain legibility while adding uniqueness through the color I choose.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The accent colors that appeared on example sites varied a lot, but I noticed that my favorite sites made use of pastel or muted tones. I find that these colors give off a relaxing atmosphere and add needed color, without being too saturated or overwhelming to the eye.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I really liked the example site below from product designer Sophie Brittain, where she uses very bright colors sparingly aside from the main illustration. I think this looks great on a white background and adds a fun spontaneous nature to the website while maintaining professionalism. I will likely use less saturated colors on my site, or use bright ones sparingly alongside black and white.</p>

                <h3>Content and Structure</h3>
                    <p>Many of these portfolio sites have a similar basic structure: homepage, about page, contacts, and internal pages with descriptions of individual projects. I like this tried-and-true framework and will utilize it in my design. On the internal pages, there are several photos of the project, a description of what the project was, and often sections like "strategy" or "process" that breakdown the way the designer approached the project.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The photo below shows an example of an internal page from designer Tamara Sredojovic that provides a concise overview to one of her case studies. I think this is a great way to organize a portfolio site and I plan to have sections addressing what the content is, my process of creating it, and its significance my overall process of learning as a designer. </p>

                <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
                    <p>These examples were inspiring to me and I found that it was a helpful exercise to search for sites similar to my own interactive narrative project idea. My impressions of their designers based on their websites has given me insight into how an audience might view me as a person based on my website.</p> 
                    <br>
                    <p>Besides the obvious like content and tone, aspects such as font, color, layout, and other styling choices will serve as a first impression of me as a designer. I look forward to applying what I've learned and adding my own personal touch to my portfolio site.</p>
