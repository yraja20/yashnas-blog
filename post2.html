            <h3>HTML Article Thoughts</h3>
            <p>The HTML article by Vlado Pavlik was helpful and gave me a deeper understanding of semantic HTML. While the tags do not literally change the code, it would be messy to read code without semantic HTML and more difficult for search engines and people using screen readers. I will likely return to this article, as the descriptions of tags like "article" and "main" helped me understand how to properly use them in my work.</p>

            <h3>Styled Article: HTML</h3>
            <p>In the article that I styled about the Sears Tower, I correctly made use of elements such as “header”, “article”, “blockquote”, and “footer” to sort the content out, with “header” containing the title and author and “footer” containing the reference links.</p> 
            <br>
            <p>I also properly used H1-H3 to go from topics to subtopics, with H1 being the title, H2 being subtopics of the whole article, and H3 being a list title within a subtopic. In a longer article with more subtopics, I would probably make use of “section” to house groups of H2s that go together. I would also use “figure” for images in articles in the future.</p>

            <h3>Styled Article: CSS</h3>
            <p>When adding CSS to my article, I made some specific choices in terms of visual design. I wanted the article to be clearly distinguishable from the header and footer, so I made it white with a border while the rest of the page was blue. I like using borders to separate things and applied one to my image too.</p>
            <br>    
            <p>I also experimented with fonts, color, and sizing in the text. I downloaded a fun sans-serif display font to use for all headers while using a simple serif font for body text. H1, H2, and H3 all have specific colors and sizes to differentiate between their meanings, while sharing the same font to show that they are all “headers” of some kind.</p>

            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <p>As for my challenges, I wanted to achieve a simple and modern look, but realized the display font sort of looks like the Hollywood sign font and makes the page look dated. Deciding on spacing between paragraphs, headers, etc. was also a huge challenge and it took me a while to get the margins and padding right.</p> 
            <br>
            <p>I also find that alignment can be quite challenging and struggle to choose between left and center for headings. Lastly, my paragraphs could certainly be broken down further to avoid walls of text.</p>

            <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
            <p>Overall, semantic HTML is crucial not only for our own organization, but for accessibility and SEO reasons. I used it correctly in my article but could use other elements to organize even better. CSS styling goes hand in hand with HTML as the way you visually separate content through font, sizing, color, and layout communicates its meaning to the reader.</p>
