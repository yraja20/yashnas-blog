            <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>Social media feels like a relatively new phenomenon in terms of the Internet, but its history goes further back than you’d think. While SixDegrees is widely considered the first social media site from 1997, an academic social media platform called PLATO was developed around 50 years ago! Since then, the Internet has strongly encouraged social interaction in many ways—from chat rooms, to discussion threads, to photo-video sharing sites, to dating apps, there are a variety of channels to interact with others around the world.</p>

            <h3>My Experience with Social Media</h3>
                <p>As a kid growing up on the Internet while many major social media sites were being released, I have used several of these sites ever since the first couple years of their existence! This includes YouTube (2005), Google+ (2011, R.I.P.), Instagram (2010)—I actually had Google+ friends who lived in other countries and we would chat daily and send memes to each other. I felt it was a great platform to make friends who I would never have met otherwise.</p>
                
            <h3>Social Media Giants</h3>
                <p>As for the dominating forces in social media, Instagram was a huge breakthrough and is now the most popular mobile app globally—while it started as a platform just for photos/videos, it has taken off with many features like Reels, shopping, direct messaging, and more.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Some other social media giants include Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, Reddit, and TikTok—all offering distinctly different social experiences. With a site like Facebook, users primarily connect with family and friends and post about their personal lives. On the other hand, a site like Reddit is more anonymous, with users typically interacting with content about niche interests and not revealing their identity or connecting with people they know in real life.</p>
                
            <h3>With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility</h3>
                <p>Social media sites are groundbreaking tools that have connected us and allowed us to share our ideas in ways we never thought possible. However, the same functions that make social media great can also make it incredibly dangerous.</p> 
                <br>
                <p>Some of the ramifications of social media include privacy concerns, addiction, and a warped perception of reality. Social media allows for potentially unwanted viewers to see personal info and content, which is why it’s crucial to be safe on the Internet and make private accounts where necessary.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Many people spend too much time and feel stuck scrolling through social media such as TikTok, where the algorithm is designed to keep your attention. Lastly, social media is highly influential in how we perceive reality. It gives anyone with a computer a platform to spread any info to millions, and can create unhealthy comparisons through constant depiction of what is considered the beauty standard or the ideal life.</p>
            
            <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
                <p>Overall, social media sites are great for connecting us to our loved ones and offering enjoyable, tailored content, but we should also be mindful of who can see our content, how much we scroll, and how the content we view affects our perception of the world, others, and ourselves.</p>
