            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>Web design is relatively new to me and I'm learning about all the complexities that go into it. While at first it seemed daunting, at its core HTML and CSS are not so hard to wrap my head around. HTML is a simple language that structures the content of our webpages, while CSS adds styling to our content.</p>
            <br>
            <p>However, these languages, especially CSS, are continuously evolving as the Internet evolves. When we design for the web, we are taking into consideration the limitations and new abilities of these languages, the everchanging nature of the Internet, and the need to consider UI/UX on a platform available to people of varying backgrounds on different devices.</p>

            <h3>Video: Why is CSS So Weird?</h3>
            <p>This video by Miriam Suzanne helped me better understand why CSS is the language used on the Internet as well as its constraints and new abilities. CSS is a declarative language from 2000 that tells a browser how to style content. Even though it's "declarative", it is really a suggestion--the content inevitably will be styled slightly differently on different devices or browsers.</p>
            <br>
            <p>As opposed to print media that has a look fully controlled by the designer, we give up some control as web designers because web media is viewed over a variety of browsers and devices--setting styling in stone would simply look bad or not function on platforms with differently-sized screens and interfaces. It might sound like a disadvantage to lose control over styling, but it allows for much more accessibility and flexibility on the users' end.</p>

            <br>
                
            <p>Because we can't have full control over how styling shows up across many devices, CSS is the perfect language to use. It is contextual in nature and thus a great tool for creating responsive designs.</p> 
            <br>
            <p>When any of our declarations don't work properly on certain browsers, they fail silently without losing content. This is due to the cascading aspect of CSS which simply ignores what is not possible and defaults to browser styling. Overall, CSS is a uniquely adaptable language that is perfect for the Internet, because it is accessed in such a wide variety of contexts.</p>

            <h3>Article: What Leonardo da Vinci Can Teach Us About Web Design</h3>
            <p>I thought this article by Frederick O'Brien was an insightful look into how web designers should approach their work, using Leonardo da Vinci's practices as inspiration. There were two pieces of advice that strongly resonated with me and that I will use in my own design journey.</p>

            <section>
            <h4>Document Your Thoughts, Ideas, and Work</h4>
            <p>Da Vinci was on top of sketching and writing many of his ideas down in his famous notebooks. This not only allowed him to iterate on them by capturing his original idea, but also allowed for creative freedom and the possibility for future generations to understand his thought process.</p> 
            <br>
            <p>As web designers, documenting ideas such as web layouts on paper is a powerful tool to allow for iteration and a way to look back at our own thought processes. To sketch or write freely is a way to let your creative stream of consciousness flow and bring you to new ideas you may not have arrived at otherwise.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
            <h4>Obsess Over Geometry</h4>
            <p>Math is a universal language that underlies almost everything you could think of. Grids and proportions are the invisible framework that nature is structured by, and Leonardo da Vinci recognized this.</p> 
            <br>
            <p>He heavily studied disciplines like math and human anatomy, because understanding the theory and mechanics of the designs you want to recreate is the way to design accurately and responsively. Da Vinci knew that in order to create realistic scenes and proportionate human figures in his art, he needed to start with a grid and outline the geometric framework.</section>
            
            <blockquote>“He who loves practice without theory is like the sailor who boards a ship without a rudder and compass and never knows where he may cast.” --Leonardo da Vinci</blockquote>
                
            <p>Grids and proportions are just as important in web design. Websites would look quite chaotic and unnatural without being built with an underlying grid or understanding of the natural relationships between elements on the page. Size, hierarchy, and layout of various elements like headers, body text, and image are factors that have standard design conventions.</p> 
            <br>
            <p>While we can sometimes break these conventions, they are there for a reason--styling with geometry and proportions as a priority looks visually clean and makes the content easier to understand or recognize for users. And at the end of the day, styling may only be the visual aspect of our web content but heavily contributes to how the meaning of our content is interpreted.</p>

            <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
            <p>Both the video and article I researched gave me a better understanding of web design. Now, I understand the uniqueness of CSS as a language and its special ability to allow the broswer some control in styling in order to suit a multitude of user interfaces. The article taught me the valuable lessons I can take from Leonardo da Vinci's processes to improve my own web designs.</p> 
            <br>
            <p> It is key to research both the tools we utilize as web designers, along with best practices to employ when using these tools. It is through this that we can become better designers who create beautiful, responsive, and accommodative webpages.</p>
