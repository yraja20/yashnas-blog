            <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>I learned a lot about CSS reading these four chapters of Learning Web Design. A property I was excited to try out was using fancy image wrapping to fit the exact outline of an oddly-shaped image. I chose a picture of a golden retriever that was transparent, and using float, webkit-shape-outside, and webkit-shape-margin, I was able to get text to wrap tightly around it.</p>

            <h3>Image Wrap Challenges</h3>
                <p>I encountered a couple of challenges while doing this. First, I realized the image needed to stay a png rather than converting to a jpg, as converting it to a jpg added a white background rather than leaving it transparent. Second, no matter what I did the text kept showing up as wrapped around the entire “box” of the image rather than fitting tightly to the dog’s outline.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Thankfully, the book warns you about this and informed me that with Chrome, I needed to upload the files to a server to see the text wrap correctly. Local files show up incorrectly due to a security feature. So, I was able to quickly upload all my files to des117.space and then the text wrap worked fine. I thought this was a fun CSS exercise and learned how to use float and shape properties to create a specific image wrap.</p>

            <h3>Other CSS Techniques</h3>
                <p>Aside from this property, the other CSS lessons in this chapter were helpful. I felt that the flexbox and grid sections helped me understand these layout tools better. Even though I already understand them decently well, the images and specific examples clarified things I was unsure about and gave helpful shortcuts.</p>

            <h3>Responsive Web Design</h3>
                <p>Additionally, the responsive web design chapter with info on media queries was very insightful. As I am in the process of adding a media query to this blog to make it desktop-friendly, I am figuring out what things I need to tweak. This book chapter is something I will be referencing often through this process, and offers advice on what you need to change and why (fonts, font size, layout, etc.).</p>
            
            <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
                <p>I look forward to adjusting my blog and feel that the new CSS knowledge I’ve gained from these chapters will come in handy. The more I learn about CSS, the more exciting it is and I realize how much you can do with it. I will also be using the new techniques I've learned when I style my personal portfolio for the interactive narrative project.</p>
